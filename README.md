## SUPER BASIC WEB PAGE FOR PURPOSE OF IMPROVING GIT SKILLS

There's literally nothing to this code. I'm purely using it as a canvas to practice git concepts.


# For example... here's a _bunch_ of **markdown**:

# Header 1 is made with a single pound
## Other, smaller headers
### Can be made
#### By adding more
##### Pound
###### Signs (up to six)

## Lists

Like this unordered list:
- As you just saw, you can add _italics_ by using _single_ underscore or asterisks.
- **Bold**, however, uses **double** underscore or asterisks.
- If you want **_bold and italic_** you just combine the two!
- Now, if you've made a ~~Merstake~~ mistake, you can strikeout text with a double-tilda.

If you want to add another list, you have to remember to add spacing between the previous bulleted item and the non-bullet text.

+ You can also use plus signs or asterisks
+ For unordered lists

If you want to have multiple lists, just use the different symbols back to back (to back)
+ Here's the first
+ set of list items
- and the second
- set of list items
* and here's
* the third

And, obviously, you can do numbered lists:
1. All you have to do
2. Is add the number
3. At the front of the line

Sublists can be accomplished by offsetting the sub lists using 3 spaces
1. Spacing, however, is platform-independent
   - GitHub requires 3 spaces
   - But other platforms
   - Can use different spacing
2. You can mix different types of sublists (bullet and number -- or roman numeral)
3. And you can create sub-sublists, too
   * Just do a second level of offsetting lines
   * Keep indenting
      1. To add more
         * Sublists
            1. Like this
      
1. You can have a number on top
   * Followed by a bullet
      
Or...
* You can have a bullet
   1. Followed by a roman numeral
      
1. Or a number
   1. Followed by a number
      1. Followed by a letter
         * Followed by something else

## Tasks

You can make tasks through the simple use of brackets:
- [ ] Here's a task
- [X] This one is completed already
